# Pattern Recognition

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on pattern recognition and neural networks. The project was completed using the QS World University Rankings dataset and Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.PyPlot, seaborn, model_selection, and preprocessing from sklearn, KMeans and DBScan from sklearn.cluster, and PCA from sklearn.decomposition.

The goal of this project was to learn about pattern recognition and neural networks and to gain insights into the factors that contribute to a university's ranking. The data analysis process involved several steps, including data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and neural network modeling.

Data cleaning was used to handle missing values and remove duplicates. Feature engineering involved selecting relevant features and transforming them into a format that is suitable for analysis. Clustering was used to identify patterns in the data, while dimensionality reduction was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Neural network modeling was used to predict a university's ranking based on its features. The neural network was trained using the dataset and validated using cross-validation techniques. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The project provides insights into the factors that contribute to a university's ranking, such as research citations, academic reputation, and employer reputation. The project also demonstrates the use of pattern recognition and neural networks in data analysis.

Overall, this project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about pattern recognition and neural networks and applying them to real-world problems. The QS World University Rankings dataset provides an excellent opportunity to practice data analysis techniques and gain insights into the factors that contribute to a university's ranking. The Python libraries used in this project are widely used in data science and provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in pursuing a career in data analysis.
